Use an INNER JOIN instead of a CROSS JOIN. Think about what the difference will be in the results for this INNER JOIN result and the one for the CROSS JOIN.

-- Select fields
SELECT c.name AS city, l.name AS language
-- From cities (alias as c)
FROM cities as c      
  -- Join to languages (alias as l)
  INNER JOIN languages AS l
    -- Match on country code
    ON c.country_code = l.code
-- Where c.name like Hyderabad
WHERE c.name LIKE 'Hyder%';
