Full join (2)
You'll now investigate a similar exercise to the last one, but this time focused on using a table with more records on the left than the right. You'll work with the languages and countries tables.

Begin with a full join with languages on the left and countries on the right. Appropriate fields have been selected for you again here.

Instructions 1/3
35 XP
Choose records in which countries.name starts with the capital letter 'V' or is NULL.
Arrange by countries.name in ascending order to more clearly see the results.

SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
-- From languages
FROM languages
  -- Join to countries
  FULL JOIN countries
    -- Match on code
    USING (code)
-- Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS NULL
-- Order by ascending countries.name
ORDER BY countries.name;

Instructions 2/3

Repeat the same query as before, using a LEFT JOIN instead of a FULL JOIN. Note what has changed compared to the FULL JOIN result!

SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
-- From languages
FROM languages
  -- Join to countries
  LEFT JOIN countries
    -- Match on code
    USING (code)
-- Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS NULL
-- Order by ascending countries.name
ORDER BY countries.name;

Instructions 3/3
Repeat once more, but use an INNER JOIN instead of a LEFT JOIN. Note what has changed compared to the FULL JOIN and LEFT JOIN results.
SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
-- From languages
FROM languages
  -- Join to countries
  INNER JOIN countries
    -- Match using code
    USING (code)
-- Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS NULL
-- Order by ascending countries.name
ORDER BY countries.name;
